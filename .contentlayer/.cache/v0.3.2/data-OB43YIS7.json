Highly customizable.\n- It directly uses Arch's main repo, which means you get the latest fixes and features.\n- You can install it via a graphical interface, which is quite cool.\n- The community is very helpful, but has its fine share of advanced users as well.\n- You're free to choose between Xfce, Budgie, Cinnamon, Deepin, i3, KDE Plasma 5, LXQt, Mate, or GNOME.\n\nThere are other Arch-based distros as well: [Artix](https://artixlinux.org/), [Arco](https://arcolinux.com/), [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/), [Garuda](https://garudalinux.org/), and many more.\nYou can try them if you want to, but sticking with Endeavour won't be a bad experience, I promise.\n\n## Choosing a Desktop Environment (DE)\n\nThe next step, after choosing the distro that you like, is to choose a [desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment) (or often abbreviated as DE).\nA desktop environment provides the user interface, as well as the underlying tools and utilities that enable you to interact with your Linux machine.\n\n### System Requirements\n\nDifferent desktop environments have varying system resource requirements.\nIf you have an older or less powerful computer, you may want to opt for a lightweight desktop environment such as [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org/) or [LXQt](https://lxqt-project.org/).\nOn the other hand, if you have a high-end system, you can choose a more feature-rich and visually appealing environment like [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) or [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/).\n\n### Customization\n\nLinux is known for its flexibility and customization options.\nIf you enjoy tweaking and customizing your desktop environment, look for one that offers extensive customization features.\n\n[KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/), for example, provides a vast array of customization options, allowing you to personalize nearly every aspect of the desktop.\nOther environments like Xfce and Cinnamon also offer a good level of customization.\n\n### Personal Rant\n\nPersonally, I don't use a DE, since I feel it's quite bloated. (GNOME, uugh.)\n\nI rather use the [i3 window manager](https://i3wm.org/), since it's fast and simple.\nA sample screenshot of a machine running Arch Linux with i3 is shown below.\n\n![Arch with i3](https://fediverse.blog/static/media/F384D5F9-9FBB-72A9-BDF8-39F4942B4442.png)\n\nThe main reason I use Arch + i3 is because the system is simple and fast to operate as a daily machine,\nbut the undeniable fact is that it's elegant and even beautiful: in one word, a tiling window manager is _cool_. Switching between windows in a subsecond with just two keystrokes is _hypercool_.\nBesides, [sway](https://swaywm.org/), [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm), [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai), [Amethyst](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst), or any other tiling window manager is also pretty cool.\n\n### Setting Up Software\n\nNow, it's time for the software, but the software itself is mostly a matter of preference (e.g., Vim vs. Emacs).\n\nBut be aware that **different distros have different availabilities with regards to software.** (You may have to entirely compile from source if your distro doesn't have what you want.)\n\nFor instance, Arch has the [Arch User Repository (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/) besides its [official repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/), a type of repository that other distros don't have.\nThe AUR is a bit loose in terms of reviewing uploaded software, thus everyone can upload their software, which is good but also potentially bad, since malicious software can be secretly deployed.\n\n### Operating System Hardening\n\nSince this is an article about Linux desktop customization, I'll also go through operating system hardening (which you might want to skip if this is your first time tinkering with your operating system).\n\nThere are several hardened operating systems available that prioritize security and incorporate various security enhancements. Here are some examples of hardened operating systems:\n\n1. [HardenedBSD](https://hardenedbsd.org/): HardenedBSD is a security-enhanced variant of FreeBSD. It includes various security features, such as ASLR, stack and heap protections, memory protections, kernel hardening, MAC frameworks, and proactive security updates.\n2. [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/): OpenBSD is an open-source operating system known for its strong focus on security. It follows a proactive security approach, emphasizing code correctness, secure defaults, and thorough code review. OpenBSD incorporates features like secure memory management, address space layout randomization (ASLR), W^X enforcement, and privilege separation.\n3. [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/): Qubes OS is a security-focused operating system that uses virtualization to create isolated compartments called \"qubes.\" Each qube runs its own operating system, and security boundaries are enforced between them. Qubes OS provides strong isolation, compartmentalization, and security features to protect against various types of attacks.\n4. [SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux): SELinux is a security framework integrated into various Linux distributions. It provides mandatory access control (MAC) policies and fine-grained access control mechanisms. SELinux enforces security policies, reduces the impact of vulnerabilities, and provides a higher level of security at the operating system level.\n5. [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/): Tails (The Amnesic Incognito Live System) is a security-focused Linux distribution designed for privacy and anonymity. It runs as a live operating system from a USB stick or DVD and routes internet connections through the Tor network, ensuring user anonymity and strong privacy protections.\n\nUsing a hardened operating system like HardenedBSD can provide additional security enhancements compared to a standard operating system.\n\nFor example, some key features and benefits of HardenedBSD include:\n\n1. Kernel hardening: HardenedBSD applies various kernel-level hardening techniques, including stronger separation of user and kernel spaces, secure memory management, and improved process isolation to mitigate kernel-level vulnerabilities and attacks.\n2. Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR): HardenedBSD implements ASLR, which randomizes the memory layout of processes, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory-based vulnerabilities.\n3. Stack and heap protections: HardenedBSD applies stack and heap protections, such as stack canaries and guard pages, to detect and prevent buffer overflow and memory corruption attacks.\n4. Memory protections: It incorporates memory protections like W^X (Write XOR Execute) enforcement, which helps prevent code execution from writable memory regions, reducing the risk of code injection attacks.\n5. Secure random number generation: HardenedBSD provides a stronger and more secure random number generation mechanism, reducing the risk of weak or predictable cryptographic keys or values.\n6. Mandatory Access Control (MAC): HardenedBSD supports MAC frameworks like MAC Framework and TrustedBSD's Security Event Auditing, enabling fine-grained access control and enhanced auditing capabilities.\n7. Proactive security updates: HardenedBSD aims to provide security patches and updates in a more proactive manner than the standard FreeBSD, ensuring that security vulnerabilities are addressed promptly.\n\nIt's important to note that although using a hardened operating system like HardenedBSD can provide added security,\nit may also introduce some trade-offs.\nThe additional security measures implemented in a hardened system can sometimes severely impact performance or compatibility with certain software or hardware configurations.\nHence, it's essential to carefully evaluate the specific requirements of _your system_ before deploying a hardened operating system. (Important! Not other people's requirements, but just what _you_ need.)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nReally, Linux desktop customization offers a wealth of options for personalizing your experience.\n\nHere's a brief recap:\n\n1. Choose a distro aligned with your customization goals, such as an Arch-based distribution like EndeavourOS.\n2. Select a desktop environment based on your system's specifications and desired level of customization.\n   Linux's flexibility allows for extensive tweaking, with options like KDE Plasma, Xfce, and Cinnamon offering robust customization features.\n3. Consider operating system hardening for enhanced security, but weigh the potential trade-offs.\n\nUltimately, Linux may empower you to create a personalized and secure desktop environment that suits your own needs and preferences.\n\nThanks for reading, and goodbye!\n",

We all know, we all praise. NoSQL! How wonderful is it?_\n\nBut, when you start diving deep in into its complexities (and its documentation), it sort of feels like... lost.\n\nAt first glance, I thought it was such a perfect database --- fast, scalable, and even developer-friendly!\n\nBut alas, after using it for a while, I realized that it wasn't all sunshines and rainbows after all.\nThe trade-offs that I thought were negligible were real, and the database itself became a constraint,\nin a different way as opposed to the usual \"constraint\" of SQL databases.\nBesides, there were a lot of nit-picky skills to learn by trial-and-error.\n\nSo this post is about the common pitfalls you would want to avoid while using MongoDB.\n\nFirst, we have the problem of abusing arrays.\n\n### Arrays\n\n> A backend developer, meeting MongoDB for the first time, being exultant and almost feeling like he found his true love:\n> **Hooray! 🥳 No more tables and relations and joins and all that stuff! It's even developer-friendly! JSON! 🎉🎉**\n\n> The day after service launch:\n> `mongodb: maximum file size exceeded.` 😔\n\nWith MongoDB, people started throwing out a bunch of array-focused models, with the rationale of \"Well, It's easier for the devs to code!\"\n\nBut software development isn't for developers. _It's for the users._ (Well, if the users are devs themselves, then it's for the developers, true, but the focus is still on the users.)\n\nUltimately, a new framework's purpose is to satisfy the user's needs better, whether it be through increasing the speed and efficiency of computation, or through enhancing\n\nBut MongoDB uses BSON.\nBSON can only store up to 16MB.\nIf the size exceeds 16MB, which quite commonly occurs for history files, log files, and the like, the database spits out an error.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nUser input gets ignored, services malfunction, servers crash (when even errors aren't properly handled), ... and **boom**💥!\n\nSo how can we fix this?\n\n#### The easier way (with caveats)\n\nThe lazy developer might say, why don't we just extend the maximum limit from,\nsay, 16MB to 64MB?\n\nAnd, it should \"work,\" thanks to the MongoDB devs who created [GridFS](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/gridfs/).\n\nHappily ever after ... or is it?\n\nThe developer will get the same error regardless, when the size of the logs hits the capacity of 64MB.\nNow, there is no GridFS to salvage him from service crashes. Eventually, he has to go through the harder way --- the pain is just delayed a bit.\n\n#### The harder way (that pays you back)\n\nThe more involved and enthusiastic developer would try to refactor the schema from the beginning.\n\nShe separates the arrays, moves each array element into a separate model,\nwhere those models would reference back the original document,\nthrough something like `'parent_id': 'some_ObjectId'`.\n\nSuch refactoring would allow the developer to query elements of that new model\nand retrieve only elements that have the `parent_id` to something.\n\nThis method achieves the same functionality while fixing the original problem, since it would never exceed the limit for most cases.\nEach element is stored in a separate document, so there should be plenty of capacity left.\n\nThe drawback of this approach might be a subtle increase in time complexity. (Perhaps, MongoDB might optimize the call and make the operations faster.)\n\n### Eventual Consistency\n\nThe next possible problem is eventual consistency.\n\nAs a NoSQL database, MongoDB doesn't provide full ACID transaction guarantees by default, but only eventual consistency.\nAlthough it sounds good, in reality, not really.\n\nHere are some issues frequently raised by eventual consistency:\n\n1. Inconsistency during replication: In an eventually consistent system, updates made on one replica may take some time to propagate to other replicas. During this propagation period, different replicas may have different views of the data, leading to temporary inconsistencies. This inconsistency can cause confusion and difficulties in maintaining data integrity.\n2. Complex application logic: Eventual consistency requires application developers to handle conflicts and reconcile data inconsistencies. This complexity arises due to the need to resolve conflicts that can occur when multiple replicas receive conflicting updates or operate on stale data. Implementing the necessary logic to handle conflicts can be challenging and prone to errors.\n3. Read anomalies: Due to the eventual consistency model, read operations might return stale or outdated data if the replica being accessed has not yet received the latest updates. This can result in read anomalies and impact the accuracy and reliability of the application.\n4. Dependency on conflict resolution mechanisms: Resolving conflicts in an eventually consistent system typically relies on conflict resolution mechanisms such as timestamps, versioning, or conflict resolution algorithms. The effectiveness of these mechanisms determines the accuracy and consistency of the final resolved data. Choosing and implementing the right conflict resolution strategy can be complex and critical to maintaining data integrity.\n5. Increased complexity in application development: Developing applications that can handle eventual consistency adds complexity to the development process. Developers need to carefully design their data models, handle conflicts, implement conflict resolution logic, and consider the impact of inconsistent data on application behavior. This complexity can lead to longer development cycles and increased maintenance efforts.\n6. Trade-off between consistency and latency: Eventual consistency prioritizes low latency and availability over strong consistency. While this trade-off can be acceptable for some applications, it may not be suitable for scenarios that require strict consistency guarantees, such as financial transactions or critical data updates.\n7. User perception and usability challenges: Inconsistencies and delays in data propagation can lead to challenges in user perception and experience. Users may encounter situations where data they expect to be updated is still stale or inconsistent across different parts of the system, which can result in confusion and frustration.\n\n### Beware of Data Duplication\n\nDenormalization, a core principle of NoSQL databases, enhances read performance by storing related data together. However, denormalization can lead to data duplication and redundancy if not managed properly.\n\n### Complex Relationships and Limited Joins\n\nNoSQL databases like MongoDB are not designed for complex joins across multiple collections. Designing data models with complex relationships can be challenging, requiring careful consideration of how data will be accessed and queried. Assess the need for complex relationships and consider alternative approaches such as embedding related data or using application-level handling to meet your requirements.\n\n### Migration Issues\n\nMoving data to MongoDB or even between different MongoDB deployments can present migration issues due to differences in schema and data modeling.\n\n### Scalability Challenges\n\nMongoDB's horizontal scalability is one of its key strengths. However, scaling a NoSQL database introduces challenges related to data distribution, consistency, and sharding strategies. One must consider factors such as data partitioning, sharding keys, and monitoring to ensure even resource utilization and optimal performance.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while MongoDB offers many benefits, it's important to be aware of and address potential pitfalls. Avoid misuse of arrays to prevent storage limit errors. Consider the complexities of eventual consistency and plan accordingly. Manage data duplication carefully when denormalizing. Be mindful of MongoDB's limitations on complex relationships and joins. Plan migrations and consider scalability challenges. By navigating these challenges, you can make the most of MongoDB's capabilities. Happy coding with MongoDB!\n",

          "raw": "\n![Twemoji Banner](https://twemoji.twitter.com/content/dam/twemoji-twitter/TwemojiSite-2048.png)\n\nHi! In this article, I'll talk about how to add twemojis to [rehype.js](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype).\n\nSince emojis had first got into the web, they always took people's attention, as they were a totally new language.\nEveryone loves emojis, right? Me too. I personally consider myself an emoji enthusiast.\nI use emojis all the time, and without doubt, [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.com) is my best friend.\n\nHowever, since emojis are system-dependent, some emojis that look pretty in your environment might just show nothing at all for other environments.\n\nHow can we solve this problem? Well, we have custom emojis!\n\nCustom emojis are emojis that are displayed as images instead of ordinary plain text.\nBy using custom emojis, we, as developers, can equally provide a consistent user experience for everyone. Hooray!\n\nNevertheless, there are plentiful number of custom emojis to choose from.\n\nMicrosoft's Segoe UI Emoji is also aesthetically pleasing, but it has a strict license, so it's actually not good, if you ever plan to use it commercially.\n\nBut hey, [twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/)🎉 to the rescue! It's totally free, open sourced --- but more importantly, it's really pretty!\nEven this website uses twemojis!\n\nOkay, so all is good, but how do we actually apply twemojis to rehype.js?\n\n### Installation\n\nFirst, let's talk about how to convert ordinary emojis to twemojis.\nPreviously, there were no plugins to convert ordinary emojis to twemojis, but don't be sad, I made one!\nYou can install the [rehype-twemojify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-twemojify) plugin with `yarn`, `npm`, `pnpm` or whatever package manager you prefer.\nI'll do it with yarn, (not yarn v2, but yarn classic) since yarn is fast and lightweight.\n\n```bash\nyarn add --dev rehype-twemojify // For yarn\n```\n\n```bash\nnpm i --save-dev rehype-twemojify // For npm\n```\n\nNow that you've installed it, try adding it to your rehype plugin list.\nIf you don't have rehype yet, you can install it using this command:\n\n```bash\nyarn add --dev rehype // For yarn\n```\n\n```bash\nnpm i --save-dev rehype // For npm\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nNow, you can use `rehype-twemojify` as follows:\n\n```ts\nimport rehype from 'rehype';\nimport rehypeTwemojify from 'rehype-twemojify';\n\nrehype().use(rehypeTwemojify);\n```\n\nIf you're using [contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) (which is really awesome, check it out) just like me, you can do the following:\n\n```ts:contentlayer.config.ts\nimport rehypeTwemojify from 'rehype-twemojify';\n\nconst contentlayerConfig = makeSource({\n  mdx: {\n    rehypePlugins: [[rehypeTwemojify]]\n  }\n});\n\nexport default contentlayerConfig;\n```\n\nFor most people, this should be enough. But if you want to customize, the next section is for you.\n\n### Next.js--Specific Options\n\nIf you're using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), here's a custom configuration, which supports using `/_next/image`, instead of the default one.\n\nJust add `framework: 'next'`, and you're good to go.\n\nIf you want to use your own twemoji files, you can add your custom base, which can be configured using `twemoji: { baseUrl: '/YOUR/BASE' }`.\nBy default, if your files are located at `/public/static/images/twemoji`, you should write `/static/images/twemoji` (since everything that goes in `/public` is located at the root of your website, at least in Next.js).\n\nFurthermore, you can set your images' width and quality via the `w` and `q` parameters in the `params` object.\n\n`params.w` is the width, and you can read more information about it on [this page](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/18413).\n\n`params.q` is the quality of the image, and usually for emojis that use small images, `40` to `70` is okay.\nImages should be rendered even if you set `params.q` to `1`.\n\nActually, you can add more parameters if you want. Internally, it works by appending those parameters to the image query url.\n\nYou can also exclude some characters that you don't want to transform, such as the `©` character, by setting the `exclude` array.\n\nAnyway, the following is a complete configuration for Next.js.\n\n```ts:contentlayer.config.ts\nimport rehypeTwemojify from 'rehype-twemojify';\n\nconst contentlayerConfig = makeSource({\n  mdx: {\n    rehypePlugins: [\n      [\n        rehypeTwemojify,\n        {\n          params: { w: 32, q: 100 },\n          twemoji: { size: 'svg', baseUrl: '/static/images/twemoji' },\n          exclude: ['©', '®', '™', '℗', '↩']\n          framework: 'next',\n        }\n      ]\n    ]\n  }\n});\n\nexport default contentlayerConfig;\n```\n\n### List of other configurations\n\nIf you're curious what other configurations you can do, here's the list.\n\n- `framework`: `'next'`, optional. When used, the images are optimized via `/_next/image`.\n- `params`: `{[key: string]: any}`, optional. You can add any parameters you want to append to the image url.\n- `folder`: `string`, optional. You may specify the folder that has the emojis, e.g., `svg` or `72x72`.\n- `twemoji.baseUrl`: `string`, optional. The base url; by default `https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest`.\n- `twemoji.size`: `string`, optional.

I wanted to explore these connections and discover new patterns and insights.\n\nOne example of such a connection was Galois theory and the Abel-Ruffini theorem.\n\nA year ago, I watched a video about this topic by Mathemaniac, and I was fascinated by the idea of a tower of radical extensions to represent the splitting field.\nIt struck me with a glimpse of something I had seen before: Gaussian integers. The first time I had encountered these “extensions,” it felt quite unnecessary to do so.\n\nBut later I realized that with the extensions, and the unique properties derived from them, it often made the previously unsolvable problems solvable. This showed me how thinking deeply about simple things, such as roots of polynomials or complex numbers, could reveal hidden symmetries and complexities.\n\n![Complex Analysis](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Gamma_abs_3D.png/1200px-Gamma_abs_3D.png)\n\nAnother area that intrigued me was complex analysis.\n\nI read a Wikipedia article about analytic continuation, a process of extending the domain of a function using its power series representation;\nthe concept of analytic continuation felt both natural and odd to me.\nExtending the domain of a function made some functions, like log(z), behave strangely, yet it was often desirable to do so. I wondered why this was the case and what implications it had for other functions and domains.\n\nThese examples made me think about how we extend mathematical ideas to the imaginary world, and then use elements from that world to solve problems that originated from our land.\nAs we proceed, we conquer the imaginary land and finally set it as a basecamp for further exploration.\n\nThis line of thinking led me to a Platonic point of view of our universe, that although we are inventors of notations, we are essentially discoverers of mathematics, which made me feel like mathematics is truly the other world that we are to discover.\n\nThen, I thought, to which extreme can we put our intuition?\n\nIndeed, the focus on intuition was what made me love number theory and combinatorics more than anything else.\nThey all arise from our basic intuition of counting numbers, but with continuous (or should I say, discrete) extensions,\nwe get to solve previously insurmountable problems.\n\nThis is why I also enjoy subjects such as graph theory, computational complexity theory, and algorithms, all of which require a high dose of intuition.\n\nI love finding elegant and clever solutions that reveal the beauty and simplicity of mathematics.\n",
