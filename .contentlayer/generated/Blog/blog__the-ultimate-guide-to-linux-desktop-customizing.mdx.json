Highly customizable.\n- It directly uses Arch's main repo, which means you get the latest fixes and features.\n- You can install it via a graphical interface, which is quite cool.\n- The community is very helpful, and has lots of advanced users.\n- Free to choose between Xfce, Budgie, Cinnamon, Deepin, i3, KDE Plasma 5, LXQt, Mate, or GNOME.\n\nThere are other Arch-like distros as well.\nArtix, Arco, Manjaro, Garuda, and much more.\nTry them if you want to, but sticking with Endeavour won't be a bad experience.\n\n# Choosing a DE\n\nI personally don't use a DE. It's bloated. I rather use the i3 window manager, since it's fast and simple.",
